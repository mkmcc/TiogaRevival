This is the README for the Tioga samples folder.

The samples can serve both as a tutorial and a source of code
fragments to provide a start on writing your own Tioga documents.

The "sine.rb" file is used in the Tutorial.

The "figures" folder has the most basic stuff.

Next comes "plots" which extends the discussion to the methods
needed to make plots.

For more information and a suggested exploration path, see
the Tutorial in the Tioga documentation.
