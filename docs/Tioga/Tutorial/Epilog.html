<p>It seems that making plots is an activity about which many people have
strong opinions. I think that&#39;s partly a result of systems that make it
trivially easy to do plots the “standard” way but painfully difficult to do
them any other way.   We&#39;ve probably all had frustrating experiences
and been left thinking “I could do that better”.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to reduce the frustrations by making it possible to work
around problems through lower level routines.  But I&#39;m still sure that
my way of structuring a plotting program will seem off target to some
users.  If you find yourself in that situation, consider using the tioga
kernel at the “figure maker” level to do PDF and TeX for you, and “do it
yourself” for plotting.</p>

<p>Look back at the sections of the tutorial.  Most of them are not specific
to plot making. Most of the methods could just as easily be used with your
plotting system as mine.  And since it is structured as a Ruby extension,
you can build your own Ruby program that loads tioga as a utility package
for writing PDF and TeX output. And if you find places where you need a
performance boost, the Ruby C API is great for that.</p>

<p>If you do your implementation using tioga as your graphics package, a lot
of messy issues go away. You can focus on specifying plots as figures, and
let it deal with the problems of turning figures into PDF and TeX. If you
decide to go that route, you have my blessings and please let me know how
it goes!</p>
